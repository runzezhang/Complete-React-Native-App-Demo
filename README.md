# React Native App with Redux / Axios / React Navigation / Expo
This is a Demo App for developers to use Redux / Axios / React Navigation to build a React Native App.
React Native is a framework to build Cross OS App, but it still need many 3-rd libraries support if you want to build a real-world App.
This demo app is like a note for me to record the path when I use React Native to build an 'useable' app.
## Why Expo Redux Axios and React Navigation
- Expo is a set of tools, libraries and services you can use to build native iOS and Android apps faster than ever before.

I build and test React Native with Expo.

- React Navigation: Solve Route and basic Navigation Components in React Native
- Redux: Manage application state, keep App up to date without setting to many triggers to update components.
- Axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The bridge between Front-End React Native and Back End API.

At least with these 3 tools I can build a useable App.
